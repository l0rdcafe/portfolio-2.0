    <div class="main__body__section--content"><h1>💭 Introduction 💭</h1>
<p><p>Hello, world. At the turn of the year, my hacker buddy <a href="https://github.com/jellyc0la" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jellyc0la</a> linked me a series of introductory tutorials titled <a href="http://learnenough.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn Enough</a>, and ever since I’ve been on a deep dive into the expanding universe of web development. He mentored me through a well-crafted curriculum, starting with front-end web development, and relentlessly emphasizing learning the fundamentals of concepts deeply.</p>
<p>After covering some basic <strong>UNIX command line</strong>, basic version control and <strong>HTML</strong>, next up was <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Odin Project’s HTML5/CSS3</a> course, a great selection of resources and interesting projects. The projects ranged from cloning the Google homepage, to its results page, a YouTube page, an older version of the apple.com homepage and a New York Times article employing a range of concepts like <strong>HTML forms, CSS Box Model, Responsive Design with media queries.</strong></p>
<p>Luckily I had <a href="https://github.com/jellyc0la" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jellyc0la’s</a> guidance a text away to triple-check my work, which proved the importance of fresh eyes and good mentorship. A particularly painful episode when an extra “/“ prevented a YouTube logo to render properly in the header springs to mind.</p>
<p>Instead of using a framework like <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bootstrap</a>, I accumulated enough technical sophistication to build my own <a href="https://github.com/l0rdcafe/cc-ss" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cc-ss</a> library, using resources such as <a href="http://getskeleton.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skeleton</a>, <a href="http://clrs.cc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clrs</a>, <a href="http://fontawesome.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">font-awesome</a>, and <a href="https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">normalize</a>. Along the way, I read a couple of <a href="http://thesassway.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SASS</a> <a href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/sass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tutorials</a> as well that were helpful in writing my framework efficiently. As my knowledge expanded, so did my arsenal of tools. I upgraded from the default <strong>Mac Terminal</strong> to <a href="https://www.iterm2.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iTerm2</a>, decked out my <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atom text editor</a> with packages and established a streamlined workflow <a href="#newdev">(More on that later!).</a> Most importantly, I ensured daily progress covering new ground and working on at least a project a day.</p>
<p>The main benefit of deep learning is a better understanding of frameworks, libraries and even languages like <strong>SASS</strong>, which I found more intuitive after covering main <strong>CSS</strong> concepts. Beyond <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>, I’ve read the first couple of chapters of <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EloquentJS</a>, a book that is a favorite amongst many programmers.</p>
<p>Although my current programming sophistication fails to show for any notable achievements, I intend on immersing myself and delving as deep into programming concepts, frameworks, libraries and everything in between as I did before. So stay tuned for the exciting upcoming projects!</p>
